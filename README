TweetFlickr is a simple node.js application that does the following:

1. Use the Flickr API to poll Flickr for photos with a specific tag
2. When photos are found, use the bit.ly API to shorten the URL
3. Use the Twitter API to Tweet the photos

To run the application:

1. Get the repository
2. Rename the Constants_.js file to Constants.js
3. Edit Constants.js so that it contains your specific Twitter, Flickr and bit.ly tokens, IDs and other required info.
4. Optionally change the Flickr tags you want to search for in Constants.js. The default is 'Vancouver'. 
5. Run the following command:

    > node TweetFlickr.js
